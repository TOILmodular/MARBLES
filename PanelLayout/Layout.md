## Panel Layout for PCB

Coordinates given in the table fit to the layout of components given in the PCBc in folder GerberFiles.
The layout is slightly different for both versions due to different positions of the output LEDs. Details are given in the coordinates table below.

Panel size: 90mm x 128.5mm

The numbers in the table are refering to the numbers in the picture below.
Coordinates origin is the lower left corner of the panel.
